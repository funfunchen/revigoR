Scripts for accessing Revigo Treemaps from R

Inspired by discussion here: https://www.biostars.org/p/70064/

Majority of script taken from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11201115/filling-up-form-using-perl-wwwmechanizeformfiller

Essentially this is a perl script which runs WWW::Mechanize to fill out the Revigo forms and access the results.

Example R script which uses the perl script is included for reference. Note that as written, this script will only work if the perl script is in your working directory.
