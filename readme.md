Inspired by discussion here: https://www.biostars.org/p/70064/

Majority of script taken from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11201115/filling-up-form-using-perl-wwwmechanizeformfiller

Essentially this is a perl script which runs WWW::Mechanize to fill out the Revigo forms and access the results.

Example R script which uses the perl script is included for reference.
